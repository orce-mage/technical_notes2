How to Increase Internet Speed
#1 Reservable Bandwidth
First and foremost, you can begin with enabling the reservable bandwidth and following this by setting it to zero. If this is done, then your system will be in a position to reserve nothing, but the twenty percent default. In order to activate the same, you need to follow a certain prescribed process.

Click on the “Start” button then click on the Run option (You can use shortcut “Windows button + R”) and type gpedit.msc. It’ll open a new window of the “Local Group Policy Editor”. Then go to

–> Local Computer Policy
–> Computer Configuration
–> Administrative Templates
–> Network
–> QoS Packet Scheduler
–> Limit Reservable Bandwidth. Click on Limit Reservable bandwidth. Then it’ll open a new window of “Limit reservable bandwidth”.

You will see the “not configured” radio button is selected by default, by default, “the Packet Scheduler limits the system to 20 percent of the bandwidth of a connection” so click on “enabled” radio button and in Options set Bandwidth limit (%) to 0. So from now, the system will reserve nothing, rather than the default 20%.
