Can't get Magento javascript component to initialize before my phtml script

I'm trying to call a Magento Javascript Component in my phtml page to get the customer data saved in session.

I'm having an issue in that the customerdata constructor gets loaded after my script and I can't figure out how to get my script to run after.

This is the customer-data.js file that needs to get loaded before my script
