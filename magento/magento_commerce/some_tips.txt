I have confirmed that your MySQL instance is currently accessible via the password configured. To correctly access it, you must SSH to your cloud server, then you may use the following commands:

Find your login credentials with:
php -r 'print_r(json_decode(base64_decode($_ENV["MAGENTO_CLOUD_RELATIONSHIPS"])));'
Then connect to the instance with:
mysql -h database.internal -u <username> -p
And enter the password retrieved from the first output when prompted.

This will connect you successfully:
web@mymagento.0:~$ mysql -h database.internal -u mysql -p
