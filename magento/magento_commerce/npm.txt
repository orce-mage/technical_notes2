There is one correction to the instructions, please replace PLATFORM_APP_DIR with MAGENTO_CLOUD_APP_DIR in your .environment file to fix the issue.
 I am reposting the full instructions below:

Step 1 - Modifying your build hooks:
hooks:
    build: |
        unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
        curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.8/install.sh | dash
        export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
        [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
        nvm current
        nvm install 9.5.0
    deploy: |
        unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX
        nvm use 9.5.0
Step 2 - Modifying your .environment file:
	In a .environment file in the root of your project:

	This is necessary for nvm to work.
	unset NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX

	Disable npm update notifier; being a read-only system it will probably annoy you.
	export NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1

	This loads nvm for general usage.
	export NVM_DIR="$MAGENTO_CLOUD_APP_DIR/.nvm"
	[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"

	Note: the example above is using 9.5.0 as a version, you would want to update that to your desired version.
