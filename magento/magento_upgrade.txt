	The following instructions show you how to upgrade Magento using Composer. 
	Magento 2.4.2 introduced support for Composer 2. If you are attempting to upgrade from Magento <2.4.1, 
	you must first upgrade to a version of Magento that is compatible with Composer 2 (for example, 2.4.2) using Composer 1 before upgrading to Composer 2 for Magento >2.4.2 upgrades. 
	In addition, you must be running a supported version of PHP.
